The script to build NekRS is `build.slurm`

###############################################################################
Cardinal

Prior to the first build, load the suggested anaconda module.

Create a conda environment and activate (default name in scripts - Cardinal)

Tie it to python v3.11.2 as that is the max version supported by MOOSE: `conda create -n cardinal python=3.11.2`

`conda install pyaml jinja2 packaging` (source:https://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/installation/hpc_install_moose.html)

Proceed to compile cardinal using the `cardinal_build.slurm` script.

bashrc setup should be optional since the scripts have everything you need.
